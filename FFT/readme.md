This is small Assignment during the course work of Advanced Data Structure.
it is for implement Fast Fourier Transformer to calculate Multiplication of two polynomial in O(nlogn) time.
general algorithm takes O(n^2) time.
we can use this FFT algorithm to multiply two large size integer which can use to calculte factorial, fibonacci number etc.
